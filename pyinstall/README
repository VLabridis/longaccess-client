./generate.sh 

1. Creates install.sh
2. Runs pyinstaller and packs the resulting binaries in 
lacli-<VERSION>.tar.bz2
3. Uploads install.sh and lacli-<VERSION>.tar.bz2 to 
download.longaccess.com (S3 bucket)

If everything goes well, users should be able to install 
lacli by running:

$ curl -s http://download.longaccess.com/install.sh | sh

It looks like it works on OS X (more testing needed).
It doesn't work for Linux (AFAIK)
